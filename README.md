My personal website source code

What it does
------------
Nothing special yet! Just static HTML with some fancy JS / jQuery


Planned features
----------------
- CSS transforms of page loads with JavaScript-powered relative position fallback
- Using [History.js](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/) to push URL state of sections of the site
- Uhm... Actually *build* a portfolio?
- Use [jQuery Masonry](https://github.com/desandro/masonry) to display my work
- Find something fun for the *Avid Cyclist* section
