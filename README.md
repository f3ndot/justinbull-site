My personal website source code

What does it do
----------------
Nothing special yet! Just static HTML with some fancy JS / jQuery

All open-source code is now managed by [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/)!


Planned features
----------------
- Uhm... Actually *build* a portfolio?
- Use [jQuery Masonry](https://github.com/desandro/masonry) to display my work
- Find something fun for the *Avid Cyclist* section
