My personal website source code

What does it do
----------------
Nothing special yet! Just static HTML with some fancy JS / jQuery

All open-source code is now managed by [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/)!

Set Up Instructions
-------------------
You'll need bower installed. `git clone` the source code to your directory and run `make install` to download all of the components for development.
